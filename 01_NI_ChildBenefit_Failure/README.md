# Case Study 01 - Northern Ireland Child Benefit Suspension Failure
 Published |  Real-World Harm |  Human Rights Violation

346 parents in Northern Ireland had their child benefit payments **suspended automatically** after returning home from a holiday through Dublin airport.
The AI-driven fraud detection system misclassified these trips as signs of **permanent emigration**.

This resulted in sudden withdrawal of essential income for families with children  
**without warning, investigation, or a human review path to correct the error.**

##  Root Governance Failures
| Issue | What Went Wrong | Required Control |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Misinterpreted travel signals | Model assumed travel via Ireland = emigration | Context & scope validation |
| No exception handling | Cross-border travel common in NI | Scenario & edge-case testing |
| Absence of human oversight | Full automation deployed on high-risk decisions | Human-in-the-loop escalation |
| Late incident response | Harm detected only after public complaints | Continuous monitoring + KPIs |

##  Impact on Human Rights
- Financial hardship for vulnerable families  
- Risk of hunger and housing instability  
- Damage to public trust in government systems
