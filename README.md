###  Mission

Automated decisions must **never** violate human rights.

I investigate real-world cases where automation harmed citizens —  
and demonstrate how **risk governance and human oversight**  
can prevent those harms **before they reach real people**.

###  My Governance Doctrine — **ROAR**

Unknown risk must never be automated into harm.

**O — Oversight by Design**  
High-impact decisions require **human review**.

Every automated outcome must have **a responsible owner**.

**R — Rights Protection**  
Human dignity is the highest KPI.
