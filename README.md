# **Automation Must Serve Humans  Not Harm Them**
### Responsible AI Incident Response & Governance Portfolio  
**By Sue Eze  Responsible AI Risk & Compliance Consultant**  
*I protect people from AI-driven harm  before it starts.*

###  Mission

Automated decisions must **never** violate human rights.

I investigate real-world cases where automation harmed citizens  
and demonstrate how **risk governance and human oversight**  
can prevent those harms **before they reach real people**.

###  My Governance Doctrine **ROAR**

**R  Risk Prevention**  
Unknown risk must never be automated into harm.

**O   Oversight by Design**  
High-impact decisions require **human review**.

**A   Accountability Enforcement**  
Every automated outcome must have **a responsible owner**.

**R   Rights Protection**  
Human dignity is the highest KPI.

###  Public Values

 Ensure fairness & accountability  
 Build public trust in AI

**More cases releasing soon.**  
**Automation must serve humans  not harm them.**
### Governance Lessons

• When data is incomplete, decisions must not progress automatically  
• Automated assumptions must be verified by accountable humans  
• Financial rights require immediate oversight escalation  

### Controls That Could Have Prevented Harm

| Risk | Control | Governance Owner |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Missing re-entry data | Human-review queue before suspension | DWP / HMRC Caseworkers |
| Assumption of departure | Context validation before action | Data Governance Lead |
| Unverified sanctions | Rights impact assessment before benefits changes | Compliance Team |
