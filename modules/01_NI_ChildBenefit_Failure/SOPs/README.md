# Standard Operating Procedures for Preventing Travel-Pattern Misclassification Harm

## Purpose
This SOP set defines the controls, reviews, and verification steps required to prevent automated systems from incorrectly identifying families as "living abroad" based on travel patterns, resulting in wrongful suspension of Child Benefit payments. The objective is to ensure that automated decision systems remain **fair, evidence-based, and defensible** under audit and public scrutiny.

## Context
In this case, an automated rules-based classification system misinterpreted short-term travel as permanent relocation. Because no human verification or hardship-impact review occurred before enforcement, families experienced **financial harm**, distress, and bureaucratic burden.

This was not a data science failure.  
This was a **governance and oversight failure**.

## Governance Principle
**Automated decisions must never be executed without human verification when the outcome can directly harm individuals or families.**

## Scope
This SOP applies to:
- Benefit eligibility systems
- Automated risk scoring or classification engines
- Any model or rule that affects citizensâ€™ access to essential entitlements

## Roles & Accountability
| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **AI Assurance Manager** | Ensures controls, logging, explainability and human review are enforced before system decisions take effect. |
| **Service Owner / Policy Manager** | Validates decision criteria against legal and social harm standards. |
| **Case Review Officer** | Conducts final human decision and documents justification. |

## Required Controls (High-Level)
1. **Pre-Release Harm Assessment** for rule or model updates.
2. **Explainability and case trace logs** to show how classifications were reached.
3. **Human-in-the-loop verification** before benefit suspension.
4. **Escalation path** for hardship or contested decisions.
5. **Impact monitoring dashboard** to detect patterns of harm in real time.

### Next Step
Detailed step-by-step SOPs will be added in `SOPs` folder for:

| SOP | Purpose |
|---|---|
| SOP-01: Case Traceability & Decision Logging | Ensures every decision can be reconstructed and defended. |
| SOP-02: Human Verification Before Suspension | Prevents automated harm. |
| SOP-03: Hardship & Vulnerability Safeguard Review | Ensures vulnerable individuals are protected. |
