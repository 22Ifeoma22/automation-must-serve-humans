           THE HOLISTIC AI HARM MAP
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 DATA  →  MODEL  →  DEPLOYMENT  →  MONITORING  →  IMPACT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1) Data Governance
   - Data representativeness checks
   - Data sheet + lineage
   - Proxy bias review
   • Failure → System learns harm

2) Model Governance
   - System card + explainability evidence
   - Fairness test plan + thresholds
   - Versioning + changelog
   • Failure → Decisions become opaque + unjustifiable

3) Deployment Governance
   - Human-in-the-loop for adverse cases
   - Go/No-Go approval gates
   - Rollback authority assigned
   • Failure → Automation runs without brake

4) Monitoring & Incident Response
   - Drift & boundary-flip alerts
   - Incident register + root cause reviews
   - Weekly cross-functional review board
   • Failure → Harm persists silently

5) Accountability & Redress (RACI)
   - Named Owner (A) + Escalation path
   - Visible appeal channel for individuals affected
   • Failure → People suffer with **no route to correction**
